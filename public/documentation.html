    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Filmtrix Using Java.node to build an interactive app for movies, lets you
      search for movies and make a list of your favorites to share with your
      friends. The app so far is pretty basic. I have used Javascript to write the index.js.
      I started off using the terminal to learn how to build a database. I moved on to SQL and Postman to learn about end points. Below is a list of the endpoints for my app.
